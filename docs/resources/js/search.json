[[{"l":"Welcome to HaCasa","p":["Welcome to the documentation of HaCasa, a custom theme for Home Assistant. Here you can find theme files as well as custom cards. You are free to roam around, check the code, reuse it and do basically with it what you want.","You can find different types of cards here with the frontend code as well as the template code. There are some dependencies you need to make use of these cards so be sure to download those!","main"]},{"i":"what-do-you-get","l":"What do you get?","p":["HaCasa is a collection of self-designed custom cards and a matching theme. With that you can create a really nice, clean but also a simple dashboard. Most of the cards are pretty simple made, but that makes it also really easy to understand them. That comes in handy when you want to edit the card to your liking.","If you created a card you want to share with the rest of the world, feel free to send me the code and I will add it to this documentation and the overall configuration."]}],[{"l":"Download","p":["Both documentation and HaCasa are still under construction!","First of all its important to create an backup from HA before you going any further. If you don't create a backup then we are not responsible for any losses (and also with a backup we aren't \uD83D\uDE09). You will need Home Assistant installed and need to have access to the configuration files so you can change them but also for uploading files.","You will also need some basic HA knowledge since you have to change files and your lovelace configuration."]},{"l":"Hacs Download","p":["HaCasa is not availble through HACS yet, but we still recommend installing HACS. There are some intergrations that HaCasa depends on which you can easily install through HACS. Manual installation is also possible, but you should check the docs for that in the specific repository of that card."]},{"l":"Manual Download","p":["Downloading HaCasa is really easy but like we said, there are some dependencies. You will need to install those first."]},{"l":"Prerequisites","p":["Button Card Required","Kiosk Mode Highly recommended","Card Mod Required","Font Awesome Highly recommended","These are all Lovelace Resources and can be downloaded through HACS."]},{"l":"Download files","p":["Download the Source code (zip) in the latest release.","Unpack the zip file and place the dashboard folder and the custom_icons folder in the root of your HA configuration. This is where your configuration.yaml is located.","You also need to place the HaCasa folder inside the theme folder into your own theme folder.","When you executed these tasks, you can move on to configuration."]}],[{"l":"Configuration","p":["Now you've downloaded and uploaded all the nesesarry files we need to change some configuration to make this all work."]},{"l":"Theme","p":["To load the theme file, you will need to add this line to your configuration.yaml","This is not only needed for the HaCasa theme, but just any custom theme you want to use.","After that, you will need to add the following code to your configuration.yaml:","Restart your Home Assistant and after it booted up, you should see a new dashboard in the menu with the name HaCasa.","Its also important that you change the theme in your HA profile. You can do that here."]},{"l":"UI Mode","p":["Home Assistant doens't allow to include folders and files in the UI-Mode. Therefore it can't be used with the structure HaCasa uses. You could add the templates manually to the raw config, but this is not recommended and thus we can't support that way of using HaCasa."]}],[{"l":"Weather Card","p":["We have 3 type of weather cards. One with the forecast, one without and one squared version. All versions have an animated icon depending on the weather."]},{"l":"Weather card with forecast","p":["Weather card without forecast"]},{"l":"Variables","p":["Variable","Default","Notes","hc_enable_forecast","true","Toggle the forecast view"]},{"l":"Usage"},{"l":"Template"}]]
